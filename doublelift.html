Doublelift hails from Mission Viejo, California. Doublelift first discovered his love for video games through the classic Nintendo 64 titles Star Fox and Golden Eye. After his brother got a computer, Doublelift frequently used it to play Diablo 1 and StarCraft. Since Doublelift's brother would buy a new computer every few years, Doublelift soon came to own his own hand-me-down desktop. This allowed him to spend more time playing computer games such as DotA, WoW, and HoN with his brother and friends. Eventually they all left these games behind and moved to LoL.
