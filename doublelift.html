Doublelift hails from Mission Viejo, California. Doublelift first discovered his love for video games through the classic Nintendo 64 titles Star Fox and Golden Eye. After his brother got a computer, Doublelift frequently used it to play Diablo 1 and StarCraft. Since Doublelift's brother would buy a new computer every few years, Doublelift soon came to own his own hand-me-down desktop. This allowed him to spend more time playing computer games such as DotA, WoW, and HoN with his brother and friends. Eventually they all left these games behind and moved to LoL.

Known for his Blitzcrank, Doublelift gained the attention of HotshotGG and duo queued together in early 2011. He was asked to join Counter Logic Gaming as a substitute which he accepted, but soon moved to Epik Gamer for a starting position as Support. He then moved on to unRestricted, now known as Curse Gaming, to become their starting AD Carry. He competed for Curse at LAN events such as IGN Proleague Season 3 - Atlantic City and IEM Season VI - Global Challenge New York.
